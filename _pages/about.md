Hello! I am a first year Ph.D. student in the theory group at the computer science department at Princeton University where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Professor Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/). I am fascinated by the intersection of computer science and social good. As such, my research interests span a broad range of computer science theory, algorithmic game theory, and CS+Law. I completed my Bachelors of Arts in Information Science at Columbia University.
