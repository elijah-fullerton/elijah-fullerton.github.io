Hello! I am a first year Ph.D. student in the theory group of the computer science department at Princeton University where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by [Professor Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/). I am fascinated by the intersection of computer science and social good. As such, my research interests span a broad range of computer science theory, algorithmic game theory, and CS+Law. I completed my Bachelors of Arts in Information Science at Columbia University.

I have been immensely fortunate to have known the support of a great number of mentors and peers. What follows is an inevitably incomplete list of acknowledgements to those who have helped me along this journey.

Much of my work is supported by the [National Science Foundation CSGrad4US Fellowship](https://cra.org/csgrad4us/).

I am indebted to my advisor [Professor Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/) for his support in my pursuit of graduate studies.

I am thankful to have had the opportunity to work with the brilliant [Professor Greg Plaxton](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~plaxton/) and [Zeyuan Hu](https://zhu45.org/) in my first professional foray into algorithmic game theory research.

At Columbia University, I had the great privelege of knowing many excellent and kind mentors. I thank [Professor Alexandr Andoni](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~andoni/) and [Dr. Lisa Zhang](https://www.nokia.com/people/lisa-zhang/) for paving my path into theoretical computer science. I am also grateful for having had the opportunity to be mentored by [Professor Ali Hirsa](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty-staff/directory/ali-hirsa) and [Josh Panknin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshpanknin/) who enabled me to develop early research skills and study many interesting problems in quantitative finance.

I am grateful to have received a [Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship](https://iris.ed.gov/programs/flas) to study Chinese at [The Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies (IUP) of Tsinghua University](https://iupchinesecenter.org/).

I began my undergraduate experience at the University of Pennsylvania, where I was fortunate enough to meet [Professor Robert Ghrist](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/), who inspired an early love of mathematics in me, and [Dr. James McGann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McGann), who inspired all of his students to strive towards accomplishing good and great things.

In my studies, I have had the pleasure of meeting a great number of exceptionally talented peers who have supported me in more ways than I can succinctly describe. While this is far from a complete list, I must thank [Chris Denq](https://cdenq.github.io/), [Minuk Lee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minuk-lee-875b9866/), and [Mark Lovett](https://math.dartmouth.edu/people/people-select.php?list=grads).
